<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I work at <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a> on GPU and CPU core architectures.</p>
<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus VR</a> on the distortion and timewarp presentation pipeline.</p>
<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve Software</a> doing Virtual Reality R&D. I wrote big chunks of the <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Oculus_Rift_User_Guide">Team Fortress 2</a> VR support for the Oculus Rift.</p>
<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a> as a software and hardware architect on the <a href="larrabee/larrabee.html">Larrabee project</a>, which became Knights Ferry/Corner/Landing, and sold as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MIC">Xeon Phi</a>.</p>
<p>I worked at the fabulous <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/">RAD Game Tools<a/> in Seattle, where I worked on <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/granny.html">Granny3D</a>, which is a runtime animation package and mesh export pipeline. If you're a games company, you'd be crazy not to at least get an evaluation.</p>
<p>I worked at wonderful wonderful Muckyfoot Productions in Guildford until its demise where I worked on <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/urban-chaos">Urban Chaos</a>, <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/startopia">StarTopia</a> and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/xbox/blade-ii">Blade II</a>.</p>
<p>In the past I have also worked at 3Dlabs, Sega, and Microprose, as well as run my own tiny games company you've never heard of.</p>
<h2>Research and Documentation</h2>
<p><a href="papers/papers.html">The Papers Wot I Wrote</a> - all my published work and lectures.</p>
<p><a href="blog.wiki.html">My blog</a> mainly about rendering. RSS feed available.</p>
<p><a href="larrabee/larrabee.html">A collection of public info about Larrabee/Knights/XeonPhi</a>.</p>
<p>I have a now rather obsolete <a href="http://tomsdxfaq.blogspot.com/">FAQ about DirectX</a> - especially useful if you need to cope with really old graphics cards.</p>
<p>I did a <a href="startopia/startopia.html">new patch for StarTopia!</a> which incorporates some of my shadowing ideas.</p>
<p>I usually hang out on the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gdalgorithms-list">GDAlgorithms</a> and <a href="http://discussms.hosting.lsoft.COM/archives/DIRECTXDEV.html">DirectXDev</a> mailing lists, and the <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/">GameDev.net</a> forums, although Twitter has replaced most of these now.</p>
<h2>Cars</h2>
<p>I have lots of hobbies, but this is my most expensive and visible one.</p>
<p><a href="car_pics/index.html">Pictures.</a></p>
<p><a href="caterham/seven.wiki.html">Caterham Seven SV</a>. Stupid fast in a straight line, corners better than anything, and with zero driver aids it's an incredibly visceral driving experience. 27mpg - eccentric British motoring madness!</p>
<p>...and another Caterham Seven SV, but this one's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tomforsyth1000">race car that I race in races</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://eelpi.livejournal.com/56157.html">Nissan GT-R</a>. Fast in an entirely different way to the Seven - it's refined and eminently capable - barely breaks a sweat until you're north of 100. Nissan have made an awesome beast of a car.</p>
<p>Ford Focus RS. Our "practical 4-door 4WD hatchback". With 350hp. And it makes childish farty noises. An absolute hooligan. I love it!</p>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<p>I helped mod a Wiki server to be more C++ friendly. <a href="Wiki.html">It's over here.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="GP32_root.html">GamePark32</a> - possibly the best handheld gaming platform in the world - ever.</p>
<p><a href = "http://eelpi.livejournal.com/">My wife's photoblog</a> - mainly hiking and birds, but also pictures of cars, holidays, etc.</p>
<p>I like XCom. And who doesn't? I used to have some very hacky tips on running XCom Apocalypse under XP which didn't really work very well and the sound was a bit funny, but the other day I just went and bought it off <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> for $5, and the chaps at Valve have made it Just Work with no screwing around.</p>
<br>
<h2>BREAKING NEWS</h2>
<p>I wrote up a bit on <a href="racing/video_setup.html">how I video my races in the Caterham.</a></p>
