<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I work at <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus VR</a> helping make the Rift the finest VR HMD in the world.</p>
<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve Software</a> doing Virtual Reality R&D. I wrote big chunks of the <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Oculus_Rift_User_Guide">Team Fortress 2</a> VR support for the Oculus Rift.</p>
<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a> as a software and hardware architect on the <a href="larrabee/larrabee.html">Larrabee project</a>, which has now become Knights Ferry/Corner/Landing, and is sold as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MIC">Xeon Phi</a>.</p>
<p>I worked at the fabulous <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/">RAD Game Tools<a/> in Seattle, where I worked on <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/granny.html">Granny3D</a>, which is a runtime animation package and mesh export pipeline. If you're a games company, you'd be crazy not to at least get an evaluation.</p>
<p>I worked at wonderful wonderful Muckyfoot Productions in Guildford until its demise where I worked on <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/urban-chaos">Urban Chaos</a>, <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/startopia">StarTopia</a> and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/xbox/blade-ii">Blade II</a>.</p>
<p>In the past I have also worked at 3Dlabs, Sega, and Microprose, as well as run my own tiny games company you've never heard of.</p>
<h2>Research and Documentation</h2>
<p><a href="papers/papers.html">The Papers Wot I Wrote</a> - all my published work and lectures.</p>
<p><a href="blog.wiki.html">My blog</a> mainly about rendering. RSS feed available.</p>
<p><a href="larrabee/larrabee.html">A collection of public info about Larrabee/Knights/XeonPhi</a>.</p>
<p>I have a now rather obsolete <a href="http://tomsdxfaq.blogspot.com/">FAQ about DirectX</a> - especially useful if you need to cope with really old graphics cards.</p>
<p>I did a <a href="startopia/startopia.html">new patch for StarTopia!</a> which incorporates some of my shadowing ideas.</p>
<p>I usually hang out on the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gdalgorithms-list">GDAlgorithms</a> and <a href="http://discussms.hosting.lsoft.COM/archives/DIRECTXDEV.html">DirectXDev</a> mailing lists, and the <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/">GameDev.net</a> forums, although Twitter has replaced most of these now.</p>
<h2>Cars</h2>
<p>I have lots of hobbies, but this is my most expensive and visible one.</p>
<p><a href="car_pics/index.html">Pictures.</a></p>
<p><a href="caterham/seven.wiki.html">Caterham Seven SV</a>. Stupid fast in a straight line, corners better than anything, and with zero driver aids it's an incredibly visceral driving experience. 27mpg - eccentric British motoring madness!</p>
<p><a href="http://eelpi.livejournal.com/56157.html">Nissan GT-R</a>. Fast in an entirely different way to the Seven - it's refined and eminently capable - barely breaks a sweat until you're north of 100. Absolutely retains the feel of the old Skyline - Nissan have yet again made an awesome beast of a car.</p>
<p>BREAKING NEWS! The black Nissan GT-R has now been replaced by... a brand new black Nissan GT-R. It looks identical.</p>
<p>Subaru Impreza WRX (the 2002 model with the bug-eye headlights). This is my "sensible" family sedan/saloon. Four doors, trunk/boot, 4 wheel drive, economical, reliable, and completely unstoppable by rain or snow. And still easily fast enough to have silly fun in.</p>
<p><a href="skyline/skyline.html">Skyline R33 GTS</a> - sadly, I had to sell this awesome car when I moved to Seattle.</p>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<p>I helped mod a Wiki server to be more C++ friendly. <a href="Wiki.html">It's over here.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="GP32_root.html">GamePark32</a> - possibly the best handheld gaming platform in the world - ever.</p>
<p><a href = "http://eelpi.livejournal.com/">My wife's photoblog</a> - mainly hiking and birds, but also pictures of cars, holidays, etc.</p>
<p>I like XCom. And who doesn't? I used to have some very hacky tips on running XCom Apocalypse under XP which didn't really work very well and the sound was a bit funny, but the other day I just went and bought it off <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> for $5, and the chaps at Valve have made it Just Work with no screwing around.</p>

<h2>BREAKING NEWS</h2>
<p>If you haven't met me recently, I changed my hair just a tad. Here's a before and after:</p>
<img src="Hair today.jpg">
<img src="Gone tomorrow.jpg">
<p>And on a happier note, I got a plaque for Larrabee / Knights Ferry. Which is cool.</p>
<p>I put the US$ quarter there for scale. I suspect there's no actual chunk of silicon inside this particular package, but still - that's a big mother hubbard of a chip. I've shipped games before, and that's pretty damn cool to see the box sitting on the shelf in the shop, but in the end it's "just" a DVD. This - this is a chunk of sand and metal processed with the finest technology in the world, and the original design and principles - I thought of that. That's pretty cool.</p>
